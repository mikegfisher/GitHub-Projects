*the coolest thing you're not using!*

### START HERE - basic GitHub
The [Community Guidelines](https://github.com/mikegfisher/GitHub-Projects/community) outline how to build and maintain your repo so that it fosters a good community of contributors. It will walk you through important steps like setting up [issue templates](https://github.com/mikegfisher/GitHub-Projects/issues/new).

#### Repo Milestones
Repos often represent either an entire app, or a system that is part of an app. In either case, [milestones](https://github.com/mikegfisher/GitHub-Projects/milestones) represent significant events in the life of a repo. Where this is a product/app milestone, or a new feature within a supporting system. Milestones are a great way to represent chunks of work that add new capabilities. 

## Projects
Projects can be related to a single repo, or an entire organization. If you are using organization projects, then you can include issues from any repo within that organization. Either way though, notes can reference issues anywhere that the user has access to. So, notes are **perfect** for defining requirements. Take a look at the [sample project](https://github.com/mikegfisher/GitHub-Projects/projects/1) in this repo (check out the view for [all projects](https://github.com/mikegfisher/GitHub-Projects/projects) too).
